### My Portfolio
As a generalist, my focus is to touch as many aspects of computer programming as possible, as early as possible. Breadth before depth is my main operating mode, and what I enjoy the most. Here is a rough map of what I have covered so far.

### My Code
This repository has a collection of small projects that are deemed too small to have their own repository. Most projects here are of the experimental/learning-new-stuff kind, and are therefore not to be used directly for serious work.
